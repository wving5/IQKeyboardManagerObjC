## IQKeyboardManager Objective-C version is less likely to maintain. Please use the Swift version for your upcoming projects https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager

## Introduction
While developing iOS apps, we often run into issues where the iPhone keyboard slides up and covers the `UITextField/UITextView`. `IQKeyboardManagerObjC` allows you to prevent this issue of keyboard sliding up and covering `UITextField/UITextView` without needing you to write any code or make any additional setup. To use `IQKeyboardManagerObjC` you simply need to add source files to your project.


## Key Features

1) `One Lines of Code`

2) `Works Automatically`

3) `No More UIScrollView`

4) `No More Subclasses`

5) `No More Manual Work`

6) `No More #imports`

`IQKeyboardManagerObjC` works on all orientations, and with the toolbar. It also has nice optional features allowing you to customize the distance from the text field, behavior of previous, next and done buttons in the keyboard toolbar, play sound when the user navigates through the form and more.

@rebeloper demonstrated two videos on how to implement **IQKeyboardManagerObjC** at it's core:

## Warning

- **If you're planning to build SDK/library/framework and want to handle UITextField/UITextView with IQKeyboardManagerObjC then you're totally going the wrong way.** I would never suggest to add **IQKeyboardManagerObjC** as **dependency/adding/shipping** with any third-party library. Instead of adding **IQKeyboardManagerObjC** you should implement your own solution to achieve same kind of results. **IQKeyboardManagerObjC** is totally designed for projects to help developers for their convenience, it's not designed for **adding/dependency/shipping** with any **third-party library**, because **doing this could block adoption by other developers for their projects as well (who are not using IQKeyboardManagerObjC and have implemented their custom solution to handle UITextField/UITextView in the project).**
- If **IQKeyboardManagerObjC** conflicts with other **third-party library**, then it's **developer responsibility** to **enable/disable IQKeyboardManagerObjC** when **presenting/dismissing** third-party library UI. Third-party libraries are not responsible to handle IQKeyboardManagerObjC.

## Requirements

|                        | Minimum iOS Target | Minimum Xcode Version |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| IQKeyboardManagerObjC  | iOS 13.0           | Xcode 13             |
| Demo Project           |                    | Xcode 15             |

Installation
==========================

#### CocoaPods

***IQKeyboardManagerObjC:*** To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerObjC' #iOS13 and later
```

#### Carthage

To integrate `IQKeyboardManagerObjC` into your Xcode project using Carthage, add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManagerObjC"
```

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to build the frameworks and drag `IQKeyboardManagerObjC.xcframework` into your Xcode project based on your need. Make sure to add only one framework, not both.

#### Source Code

***IQKeyboardManagerObjC:*** Just ***drag and drop*** `IQKeyboardManagerObjC` directory from demo project to your project. That's it.

#### Basic Usage

In `AppDelegate..m`, just `#import <IQKeyboardManagerObjC/IQKeyboardManager.h>` framework and enable IQKeyboardManager.

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <IQKeyboardManagerObjC/IQKeyboardManager.h>

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [[IQKeyboardManager sharedManager] setEnable:YES];
    return YES;
}

@end
```
